You wake up in what you guess is a solitary confinement room. You cannot recall why<br>
you're here, nor the events of the previous day, or any day before it for that matter.<br><br>
</center>

END 	- START; DESC:
<center>
You look around the room and see that there's really not much to note:<br>
After all, it <i>is</i> supposed to be a room void of anything one could interact with and a door with<br>
no handle on the inside. The walls are a pale grey, perhaps they once upon a time could have<br>
been called white. The room is pretty run-down, in one of the corners you see some dried, bloody<br>
marks on the wall. You can see a small crack in between the floor tiles.
 </center>

 
END 	- START; BLOODY MARKS:
<center>
You walk over to the corner and take a look at the bloody marks... The blood has long since<br>
dried. It appears that whoever was its owner, repeatedly hit their head against the wall. To<br>
the left of the blood hit-mark, the blood forms some strange symbols, you are not entirely<br>
sure of what to make of them. The more you stare at them, the less sane you feel.
</center>

END 	- START; HAS KNIFE:
<center>
You stick the knife between the sharp edges of the crack and underneath the floor-tile, after<br>
lifting it, you remove the tile and find a small #### beneath it. Perhaps the tile didn't<br>
break due to being worn out?
</center>
  
END 	- START; NO KNIFE:
<center>
You stick your fingers into the crack and try to lift it, you barely manage to touch the<br>
tile before cutting your fingers on its sharp edges. You doubt that you'll be able to budge<br>
it with your bare hands.
</center>
