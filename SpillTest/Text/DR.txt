You walk into a huge square room with two long tables in the middle of it.
</center>
<center>
Half the room is covered by a curtain of darkness. It appears that someone or something has been in the<br>
room recently - a patient perhaps as there are visible trails pacing between the between the tables and the<br>
doors in the dust covering the room. Judging by the circular spots in the dust on top of the left table,<br>
someone must have eaten here recently.

Ever since you've walked into this room you've felt as if some sort of strange<br>
presence was watching your every move.<br>
</center>
<center>
In the corner of the dark side of the room there seems to be a shadow, swaying back and forth slowly.<br>
</center>
<center>
You feel that whatever it is that's casting the shadow, you'd rather not want to find out.<br>

You feel confident about being able to handle whatever it is that's casting the shadow.<br>

<center>
As you walk through the darkness you look around for anything of interest, but suddenly, you hear a<br>
quiet yet terrifying growl. You trip and hit your arm on something in the confusion, then quickly run out<br>
of the darkness.<br>
</center>

 Something seems to be spilled at the edge of the darkness closer<br>
to the other table.<br>

 Fresh blood seems to be spilled at the edge of the darkness closer<br>
to the other table.<br>

There is nothing else of interest in this room other than the barely readable message on the wall.<br>
Thankfully the message is written with a slightly shining, dark red substance - you get a feeling that it'd<br>
be best not to think about what was used to write this. Whatever the message might refer to, it might be<br>
important since someone has spent some time of their life - literally - to write it.<br>
